# Translation

Moving forward (after 2022/12/07); IronOS is using Weblate to provide the visual interface to doing translations to make it easier for people to work with.
Currently there is a translation going on, so not _everything_ is perfect but its leaps in the right direction to help make it friendlier for people to edit and also subscribe to be notified when things are updated.

This can be accessed on the [weblate hosted instance](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/ironos/main-firmware/).
